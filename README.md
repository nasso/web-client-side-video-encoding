it seemed so cool to be able to encode videos directly in the web browser
without any server!

## tl;dr

you can, it's okay for really simple stuff, but as soon as you wanna do
something like _SPECIFY THE FRAMERATE_ whilst _MANUALLY REQUESTING FRAMES ONE BY
ONE_, you're out of luck.

oh also, it isn't consistent across browsers: firefox will produce a video with
a constant framerate and chrome a video with variable framerate. well feel free
to clone/fork and mess with this.
